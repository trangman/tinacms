# Welcome to Our New Blog!

This is our first blog post created with **TinaCMS** and **Next.js**. We're excited to share our journey with you as we build a modern, content-driven website.

## What Makes This Special?

- **Git-based content management** - All content is stored in Git
- **Real-time editing** - Edit content directly in the browser
- **Approval workflow** - Posts go through review before publishing
- **Category organization** - Organize posts by topics
- **Hero images** - Beautiful visuals for each post

## Getting Started

To get started with content creation, simply visit the `/admin` route and start creating your first post. The interface is intuitive and powerful, making content management a breeze.

## Next Steps

We'll be adding more features and content regularly. Stay tuned for updates on:

- Advanced content types
- Custom fields
- SEO optimization
- Performance improvements

Thank you for joining us on this journey!
